# CNN for Fashion MNIST

## Description
this project have been developed as part of a self though learning path of deep leraning. In this project have been used Keras API and tensor flow to develop a CNN to clasify 10 classes within MNIST dataset.

## Dataset
This project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of clothing items categorized into 10 classes.

## Model
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify Fashion MNIST images.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- matplotlib
- numpy
- sklearn
- tensorflow

You can install missing dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the following command to execute the notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook CNN_fashion_mnist.ipynb
```

## Results
The model has an accuracy of 92.87% in training dataset, 92.17% in validation dataset and 92.14% in test.
